In this project, STATE is used to keep track of data like the search text and the "in stock only" checkbox. These values are passed down to child components, like SearchBar and ProductTable, as PROPS. When the user types in the search bar or toggles the checkbox, the STATE updates, and the parent component re-renders the page with the updated data. This allows the application to show the correct products based on the userâ€™s input.
